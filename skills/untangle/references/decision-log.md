# Decision log example

Step 2 lists the problems, one line each with its location:

```md
- `ui/LogoutDialog.tsx:30` waits 100ms after closing and hopes the message input can take focus by then.
- `ui/Toolbar.tsx:40` and `ui/Menu.tsx:22` call the same actions, each with its own check for when they're disabled.
- `checkout/submit.ts:9` depends directly on `payments/stripe.ts`.
- `shortcuts/keymap.ts:18` has a switch with one case per action, separate from the menu's list.
- `ui/CommandPalette.tsx:55` keeps its own list of actions, and it's missing the newer ones.
- `ui/SettingsDialog.tsx:61` sets a global `skipRefocus` flag to stop the logout dialog it opens from sending focus to the message input.
- `history/undo.ts:30` has a special case for every action that can be undone.
- `refunds/refund.ts:22` wraps every Stripe call in `if (order.provider === "paypal")`.
- Every action handler has to call `track()` by hand, and some don't.
- `ui/Toolbar.test.tsx` and `ui/Menu.test.tsx` test the same actions separately.
```

Step 3 writes each fix above the problems it solves. One fix usually covers several problems:

```md
- Make the general `Dialog` give focus back to whatever had it before it opened, so the wait and the flag can both go.
  - `ui/LogoutDialog.tsx:30` waits 100ms after closing and hopes the message input can take focus by then.
  - `ui/SettingsDialog.tsx:61` sets a global `skipRefocus` flag to stop the logout dialog it opens from sending focus to the message input.
- Define a `PaymentProvider` interface that Stripe and PayPal both implement, so checkout and refunds no longer know which one they're using.
  - `checkout/submit.ts:9` depends directly on `payments/stripe.ts`.
  - `refunds/refund.ts:22` wraps every Stripe call in `if (order.provider === "paypal")`.
- Make every user action a command with a name, a handler and an undo, so the toolbar, menu, shortcuts, palette and undo history all run from one list.
  - `ui/Toolbar.tsx:40` and `ui/Menu.tsx:22` call the same actions, each with its own check for when they're disabled.
  - `shortcuts/keymap.ts:18` has a switch with one case per action, separate from the menu's list.
  - `ui/CommandPalette.tsx:55` keeps its own list of actions, and it's missing the newer ones.
  - `history/undo.ts:30` has a special case for every action that can be undone.
  - Every action handler has to call `track()` by hand, and some don't.
  - `ui/Toolbar.test.tsx` and `ui/Menu.test.tsx` test the same actions separately.
```
